# Arkanoid-Game
This is a fun Java remake of the classic Arkanoid game. You control a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the blocks across different levels. Itâ€™s got smooth animations, easy keyboard controls, and lets you pick which levels to play. A cool project to practice Java and game programming basics.
